# News Articles App
This app retrieves the latest content from Dagens industri's, Expressen's and Dagens Nyheter's RSS-feeds and displays a list of the ten most recently published articles, sorted by publish date in a collapsible view.

### Running the app
Start the app with:
`npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.\
(If the app does not work in Safari, try it in Chrome). If you're having troubles in chrome, try adding a web browser plugin that allows you to send cross-domain requests.
